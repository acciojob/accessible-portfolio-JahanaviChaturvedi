		<p>ARIA (Assistive Rich Internet Applications), is a spec from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that was created to improve accessibility of web pages and applications by providing extra information to screen readers via HTML attributes.
			Screen readers work with regular HTML, but adding ARIA can provide screen reader users with greater context and interactivity with the content on the page. ARIA has no effect on how elements are displayed or behave in browsers. It does not add new functionality, and is meant to act only as an extra descriptive layer for screen readers.</p>
